At first “Public Path“ was about the idea of circularity that when we leave and come back home. Distances from home were measured and mapped over time on a polar visualization. Each of the days tracked acted as a fingerprint. The patterns provided possible analysis of individuals and their implicit information about the transportation, occupation and vaguely social situation. The project group experimented with different mapping techniques and developed different prototypes, each referring to the circular aspect of the paths throughout a day. Through 3D scanning, game engines and geospatial mapping techniques we developed a digital space in which we tried new mapping approaches of public space by entangling quantitative  and qualitative data.
