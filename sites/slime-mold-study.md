The so-called "Slime Mold" has shown astonishing abilities to solve optimization problems that concern resource efficiency. In an experiment conducted by Harvard scientists, the organism simulated a network between stations in the Tokyo area and, when compared to the real rail network, showed outstanding accuracy. Based on these findings, I experimented for two weeks with an algorithm resembling the real-world behavior of the slime mold. In the study, I tried to connect all capital cities of the German states and later the public transportation network of Berlin. I played with color shifts and layering over time, which created not only a unique and magnificent display but also offered interesting options to analytically examine the outcomes.
From this theoretical point on I experimented with the idea to create an interactive way to categorize a space in different subjective ways. This should emphasize that the very same physical space can be observed and operationalized differently. A first attempt can be seen in the pictures below. Users could define their own “areas of interest” and label with different associations.
