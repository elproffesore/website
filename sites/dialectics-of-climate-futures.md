Anthropogenic climate change is more relevant than ever. Despite the scientific evidence that has been gathered and substantiated in recent decades, social fronts are sharpening and polarizing. Thus, we find that the discussion about the climate crisis must not only be approached from the quantitative side, but also from the qualitative, emotional side. In addition to dealing with the topic using the conventional methods of economics and the natural sciences, the art and design the art and design disciplines must also assume their responsibility. In this context, the development of narratives and visions, as well as the presentation of complex the representation of complex interrelationships are of central importance. Through dialectics - the method of gaining knowledge through logical argumentation along opposing positions - we want to get out of our usual filter bubbles.

With the project "Dialectics of Climate Futures" we want to clarify these interwoven relationships and initiate a discourse. We use an emotional framed artificial intelligence as a means to get in touch with opposing emotional states. Through the process of the interaction we hope to break out of our thought patterns and constructively confront possibly uncomfortable emotional counterparts. At the end the goal is the ask and discuss the question “can we find common ground?”.
