Our studio topic was “Terrestrial” which has broad possibilities of interpretation. Initially I was engaged in the phenomena of “zooming” which was significantly harder to grasp or coin than I initially expected. During my research about “zooming” I came across several interesting ideas how to approach the term. One could even describe the hyperlinks and the hidden information behind it as “zooming”. I recognized that the practice of zooming often started with a perceptual or theoretical cue that draw the attention of observers to a specific region that was initially not well observable. Outstanding was that same structures could be observed in different professions and they were hierarchically described differently in several professions. This phenomena was already coined by Gottlob Frege in his famous “Sinn und Bedeutung” explanation. Ideally we would have an interface to the “real world” where we could map everything in an bijective way. Such a system would allow us to share information about everything in a way that would be free of contradictions. From early on people studied on this idea of an isomorphism between the “real world” and systems to transfer information (such as semiotics, or spoken language). But till now the remaining opinion is that this is not possible (Gödel).

From this theoretical point on I experimented with the idea to create an interactive way to categorize a space in different subjective ways. This should emphasize that the very same physical space can be observed and operationalized differently. A first attempt can be seen in the pictures below. Users could define their own “areas of interest” and label with different associations.
