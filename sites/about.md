## About

My name is Philipp and I study Design & Computation at Technische Universität Berlin and Universität der Künste Berlin. Design & Computation is part of the new interdisciplinary research platform New Practice which I’m also part of. I have a degree in Mediatechnologies from Hochschule der Medien, Stuttgart and  I’m practically interested in data visualization and concept artwork about natural language processing.

Through my studies I artistically research topics such as generative AI, algorithmic bio mimicry and natural language. The work that I do is influenced by different figures like Bruno Latour, Timothy Morten, Douglas R. Hofstadter and the philosophical movement of New Materialism. The interconnectedness in nature and often dialectical behaviour of science drives me to explore more relevant explanations of this complex thing we call “world”.
