Hi! My name is Philipp – I'm a designer and creative technologist. I have an M.A. Design & Computation (TU Berlin and UdK Berlin) and a B.E. in Media Technologies (Media University Stuttgart). My interests include data interfaces, data visualizations, node-based interfaces, computational social science and the digital humanities. In my free time I enjoy playing table tennis, spikeball and reading books.

### Textarium: Entangling Annotation, Abstraction and Argument
Textarium is a web-based tool I designed to support reading and writing in a more interactive and visual way. With Textarium, users can highlight text, group keywords into concepts, and embed their annotations directly into interactive essays. The interface turns the interpretation process into tangible text visualizations, making it easier to see and share how the idiosycratic analysis unfolds. Throughout the project, I focused on creating an augmented  environment, that combines lightweight algorithmic analysis and human interpretation for exploring and communicating findings in digital texts. 

In additional iterations together with [Marian Dörk](https://mariandoerk.de/) we explored possible different design directions for the tool, focusing on the interplay between communication and visualization. As a result, we developed a small prototype that allows users to visually analyze text passages and embed their annotations in an interactive storytelling format.

Test out the prototype on [https://uclab.fh-potsdam.de/textarium/](https://uclab.fh-potsdam.de/textarium/) and read the [academic paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13191) (preprint) which will be presented on the [IEEE Vis 2025](https://vis4dh.dbvis.de/accepted/).

### Forever Lost Deutschland?

This project was done in the context of a [data journalism class at FH Potsdam](https://uclab.fh-potsdam.de/mapping/). Throughout the semester a dataset from the [SOSEC](https://www.socialsentiment.org/sosec-dashboard/) workgroup at KIT and FZI was analyzed and synthesized with other datasets for establishing geographic and economic relations between the datapoints. Central to the analysis was the definition of the "perceived crisis level", which was indicated by several proxy references (such as anger, depression, money sorrows and doomsday mood).

### From Space to Place

From Space to Place is an interdisciplinary exploration to understand the complex interplay between environement and human interventions. The projects aim was to get a more holistic approach for understanding and mapping a space. As we researched different methods for understanding the environment from an interdisciplinary perspective, we began to shift our idea of space into a more constructed notion of "place". One of our outcomes was an installation that seeks to create an experience that allows participants to perceive the changing physical environment as a continous evolving digital representation, utilizing technologies such as pointclouds to reveal the layered transformations that places undergo.

### Generative Syllabus Site 
A syllabus site is a website that contains all the information about a class. It is usually structured in a linear way and is not very flexible. The aim of this project was to create a new kind of syllabus site that would allow the students to explore the content of the class in a more playful way. It also allows students to see the process and prototypes from a past class. The structure of the project also provides the opportunity for non-programmers to create their own syllabus sites with a markdown file, which automatically generates the visualisation via the application. Find out more on the [explanatory site](https://infovis.fh-potsdam.de/syllabussite/).

This project was done together with [Prof. Marian Dörk](https://mariandoerk.de/) from the [UCLAB](https://uclab.fh-potsdam.de/) and the code is [open source](https://github.com/uclab-potsdam/syllabus-site/).

### Dialectics of Climate Futures 
> Anthropogenic climate change is more relevant than ever. Despite the scientific evidence that has been gathered and substantiated in recent decades, social fronts are sharpening and polarizing. Thus, we find that the discussion about the climate crisis must not only be approached from the quantitative side, but also from the qualitative, emotional side. 

In addition to dealing with the topic using the conventional methods of economics and the natural sciences, the art and design disciplines must also assume their responsibility. In this context, the development of narratives and visions, as well as the presentation of complex interrelationships are of central importance. Through dialectics - the method of gaining knowledge through logical argumentation along opposing positions - we want to get out of our usual filter bubbles. "Dialectics of Climate Futures" wants to clarify the interwoven relationships and initiate a discourse. We use an emotionally framed artificial intelligence as a means to get in touch with opposing emotional states. Through the process of the interaction we hope to break out of thought patterns and provoke thought experiments. The goal is to ask and discuss the question:

<b>Can we find common ground?</b>

To this date the project was exhibited at the Manifest:IO Symposium for Electronic Art and New Media, the first event of the Symbiotism collective at Disko Babel and the Ars Electronica Festical 2023.
