Hi! My name is Philipp – I'm a designer and creative technologist. I have an M.A. Design & Computation (TU Berlin and UdK Berlin) and a B.E. in Media Technologies (Media University Stuttgart). My interests include data interfaces, data visualizations, node-based interfaces, computational social science and the digital humanities. In my free time I enjoy playing table tennis, spikeball and reading books.

### SPLEE / Hyper Visual Times
Hyper Visual Times contains a series of reflections on the circulation and consumption patterns of news in the digital environment. Using metadata from several newsrooms’ archives, each experiment deals with a feature of digital news: keywords, text, and images. Using a combination of computational methods, three individual chapters pivot around a series of design and data visualization experiments with news data.

### Textarium: Entangling Annotation, Abstraction and Argument
Textarium is a web-based tool to support reading and writing in a more interactive and visual way. With Textarium, users can highlight text, group keywords into concepts, and embed their annotations directly into interactive essays. The interface turns the interpretation process into tangible text visualizations, making it easier to see and share how the idiosycratic analysis unfolds. The project focused on creating an augmented environment, that combines lightweight algorithmic analysis and human interpretation for exploring and communicating findings in digital texts.Additional iterations, together with [Marian Dörk](https://mariandoerk.de/), explored possible different design directions for the tool, focusing on the interplay between communication and visualization. As a result, a prototype was built that allows users to visually analyze text passages and embed their annotations in an interactive storytelling format.

### Website Studium Planetare
Studium Planetare is a two-year, student-initiated and led pilot project by [Klasse Klima](https://klasseklima.de) in collaboration with the Studium Generale at the Berlin University of the Arts. The programme offers students and teachers at Berlin University of the Arts and beyond a forward-looking and interlinked range of courses on climate justice and planetary futures. To document and provide a calendar, a website was designed and developed that allows the Klasse Klima people to manage their courses and events.

### Forever Lost Deutschland?

"Forever Lost Deutschland?" was done in the [data journalism class at FH Potsdam](https://uclab.fh-potsdam.de/mapping/). Throughout the semester a dataset from the [SOSEC](https://www.socialsentiment.org/sosec-dashboard/) workgroup at KIT and FZI was analyzed and synthesized with other datasets for establishing geographic and economic relations between the datapoints. Central to the analysis was the definition of the "perceived crisis level", which was indicated by several proxy references (such as anger, depression, money sorrows and doomsday mood).

### From Space to Place

From Space to Place is an interdisciplinary exploration to understand the complex interplay between environement and human interventions. The projects aim was to get a more holistic approach for understanding and mapping a space. As we researched different methods for understanding the environment from an interdisciplinary perspective, we began to shift our idea of space into a more constructed notion of "place". One of our outcomes was an installation that seeks to create an experience that allows participants to perceive the changing physical environment as a continous evolving digital representation, utilizing technologies such as pointclouds to reveal the layered transformations that places undergo.

### Generative Syllabus Site 
A syllabus site is a website that contains all the information about a class. It is usually structured in a linear way and is not very flexible. The aim of this project was to create a new kind of syllabus site that would allow the students to explore the content of the class in a more playful way. It also allows students to see the process and prototypes from a past class. The structure of the project also provides the opportunity for non-programmers to create their own syllabus sites with a markdown file, which automatically generates the visualisation via the application.
This project was done together with [Prof. Marian Dörk](https://mariandoerk.de/) from

### Dialectics of Climate Futures 
Anthropogenic climate change is more relevant than ever. Despite the scientific evidence that has been gathered and substantiated in recent decades, social fronts are sharpening and polarizing. Thus, we find that the discussion about the climate crisis must not only be approached from the quantitative side, but also from the qualitative, emotional side. 

In addition to dealing with the topic using the conventional methods of economics and the natural sciences, the art and design disciplines must also assume their responsibility. In this context, the development of narratives and visions, as well as the presentation of complex interrelationships are of central importance. Through dialectics - the method of gaining knowledge through logical argumentation along opposing positions - we want to get out of our usual filter bubbles. "Dialectics of Climate Futures" wants to clarify the interwoven relationships and initiate a discourse. We use an emotionally framed artificial intelligence as a means to get in touch with opposing emotional states. Through the process of the interaction we hope to break out of thought patterns and provoke thought experiments. The goal is to ask and discuss the question: <b>Can we find common ground?</b>

Dialectics of Climate Futures was exhibited at the Ars Electronica Festival 2023.
