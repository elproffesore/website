My name is Philipp, I have a degree in Mediatechnologies from Hochschule der Medien, Stuttgart and currentyl study Design & Computation at Technische Universität Berlin and Universität der Künste Berlin. Design & Computation is part of the new interdisciplinary research platform <a href="(https://www.newpractice.net/)">New Practice</a> which I’m also part of. I’m practically interested in data visualization and concept artwork about media theory.

Through my studies I artistically research topics that investigate the impacts and weird things of technology.

# Dialectics of Climate Futures
<div class="img-wrapper"><img class="cover" src="/media/dialectics-of-climate-futures/bild-cover.jpeg" alt=""/>
<hr></div>

Anthropogenic climate change is more relevant than ever. Despite the scientific evidence that has been gathered and substantiated in recent decades, social fronts are sharpening and polarizing. Thus, we find that the discussion about the climate crisis must not only be approached from the quantitative side, but also from the qualitative, emotional side. In addition to dealing with the topic using the conventional methods of economics and the natural sciences, the art and design the art and design disciplines must also assume their responsibility. In this context, the development of narratives and visions, as well as the presentation of complex the representation of complex interrelationships are of central importance. Through dialectics - the method of gaining knowledge through logical argumentation along opposing positions - we want to get out of our usual filter bubbles.

With the project "Dialectics of Climate Futures" we want to clarify these interwoven relationships and initiate a discourse. We use an emotional framed artificial intelligence as a means to get in touch with opposing emotional states. Through the process of the interaction we hope to break out of our thought patterns and constructively confront possibly uncomfortable emotional counterparts. At the end the goal is the ask and discuss the question “can we find common ground?”.

To this date the project was exhibited at the Manifest:IO Symposium for Electronic Art and New Media, the first event of the Symbiotism collective at Disko Babel and at the Ars Electronica 2023 Festival.

# Public Path

“Public Path“ startet with a solo project called "Coming Home". The path was shaped by chores and spontanous actions. Distances from home were measured and mapped over time on a polar visualization. Each of the days tracked acted as a fingerprint. The patterns provided possible analysis of individuals and their implicit information about the transportation, occupation and vaguely social situation. The project also offered a new kind of mapping of the city through the subjective movement of the individuals. A body in space, the movement curve shaped by the environment. The project group experimented with different mapping techniques and developed different prototypes, each referring to the circular aspect of the paths throughout a day. Through 3D scanning, game engines and geospatial mapping techniques we developed a digital space in which we tried new mapping approaches of public space by entangling quantitative and qualitative data.

# Slime Mold Study
<div class="img-wrapper"><video src="/media/slime-mold-study/video-cover.mov" autoplay loop></video>
<hr></div>

The so-called "Slime Mold" has shown astonishing abilities to solve optimization problems that concern resource efficiency. In an experiment conducted by Harvard scientists, the organism simulated a network between stations in the Tokyo area and, when compared to the real rail network, showed outstanding accuracy. Based on these findings, I experimented for two weeks with an algorithm resembling the real-world behavior of the slime mold. In the study, I tried to connect all capital cities of the German states and later the public transportation network of Berlin. I played with color shifts and layering over time, which created not only a unique and magnificent display but also offered interesting options to analytically examine the outcomes.
