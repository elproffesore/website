### Introduction
Hi, my name is Philipp and I study [Design & Computation](https://www.newpractice.net/study) at Technische Universität Berlin and Universität der Künste Berlin. I’m interested in data and media visualization, interfaces and media theory.

### Forever Lost Deutschland?

This project was done in the context of a [data journalism class at FH Potsdam](https://uclab.fh-potsdam.de/mapping/). Throughout the semester a dataset from the [SOSEC](https://www.socialsentiment.org/sosec-dashboard/) workgroup at KIT and FZI was analysed and synthesized with other datasets for establishing geographic and economic relations between the datapoints. Central to the analysis was the definition of the "perceived crisis level", which was indicated by several proxy references (such as anger, depression, money sorrows and doomsday mood). 

The perceived level of crisis has been an interesting indicator for analysing the overestimation of situations that are normally not noticable for people without this feeling. The connection between the perceived crisis level and democracy fatique or extremism, has also shown why there should be more emphasize on the improvment of living conditions. This improvment could be achieved by increased intervention to integrate groups of people that are left behind due to economical or societal reasons.

### From Space to Place

From Space to Place is an interdisciplinary exploration to understand the complex interplay between environement and human interventions. The projects aim was to get a more holistic approach for understanding and mapping a space. As we researched different methods for understanding the environment from an interdisciplinary perspective, we began to shift our idea of space into a more constructed notion of "place". 

One of our outcomes was an installation that seeks to create an experience that allows participants to perceive the changing physical environment as a continous evolving digital representation, utilizing technologies such as pointclouds to reveal the layered transformations that places undergo. The different scenarios are accompanied with spoken memories that are connected to these places at a specific time. By highlighting the ever changing relationship between places and experience over time, our installation offers a novel perspective on how digital representations can complement and preserve a place and the human subjective gaze connected to it.

### Generative Syllabus Site 
This project was done together with [Prof. Marian Dörk](https://mariandoerk.de/) from the [UCLAB](https://uclab.fh-potsdam.de/). A syllabus site is a website that contains all the information about a class. It is usually structured in a linear way and is not very flexible. The aim of this project was to create a new kind of syllabus site that would allow the students to explore the content of the class in a more playful way. It also allows students to see the process and prototypes from a past class. The structure of the project also provides the opportunity for non-programmers to create their own syllabus sites with a markdown file, which automatically generates the visualisation via the application.

The code is [open source](https://github.com/uclab-potsdam/syllabus-site/)

There is an [explanatory site](https://infovis.fh-potsdam.de/syllabussite/) and sites for two classes of the FH Potsdam:<br>
["Decolonizing Data Visualization – Visualizing Postcolonies"](https://infovis.fh-potsdam.de/decolonizing/)<br>
["Organigrams for/from the future"](https://infovis.fh-potsdam.de/organigrams/)

### Dialectics of Climate Futures 
> Anthropogenic climate change is more relevant than ever. Despite the scientific evidence that has been gathered and substantiated in recent decades, social fronts are sharpening and polarizing. Thus, we find that the discussion about the climate crisis must not only be approached from the quantitative side, but also from the qualitative, emotional side. 

In addition to dealing with the topic using the conventional methods of economics and the natural sciences, the art and design disciplines must also assume their responsibility. In this context, the development of narratives and visions, as well as the presentation of complex the representation of complex interrelationships are of central importance. Through dialectics - the method of gaining knowledge through logical argumentation along opposing positions - we want to get out of our usual filter bubbles.

This project was part of the "Tangible Climate Data" class that investigated new ways to question and visualize the complex topic of climate change. "Dialectics of Climate Futures" wants to clarify the interwoven relationships and initiate a discourse. We use an emotionally framed artificial intelligence as a means to get in touch with opposing emotional states. Through the process of the interaction we hope to break out of thought patterns and provoke thought experiments. The goal is to ask and discuss the question:

<b>Can we find common ground?</b>

To this date the project was exhibited at the Manifest:IO Symposium for Electronic Art and New Media, the first event of the Symbiotism collective at Disko Babel and the Ars Electronica Festical 2023.

### Explorative Coding Practices

Coding interfaces has been an interesting journey for me over the course of the last 5 years. The work on interfaces has shown me the multitude of possibilites to use them – from visual organisation of information to practices that can be quite philosophical, recreational and political. I use code as a means for exploring new ways to organize my thoughts and interact with them through graphic means paired with computational methodologies.
