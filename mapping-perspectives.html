                    We see a couple picnicking in the grass. Then we realize they are not just sitting in the grass, but
                    in a large park, adjacent to a harbor, in a large city built right on the ocean, or rather on a very
                    large lake, Lake Michigan, which itself is surrounded by even larger land masses. It follows the
                    earth, the solar system, our galaxy, and finally the whole universe, surrounded by a square on whose
                    side: '100 million light years' and on the other side: '10^24m' is written, and is supposed to
                    represent the largest possible size of the universe. After that the video 'zooms in' again, from
                    10^24 meters to 10^-13 meters, the size of an atomic nucleus, which itself consists of further
                    particles. The described scenario from the video Powers of Ten by Eames Office allows the following
                    interpretation: depending on the scaling and the viewing plane, reality looks different. Not only in
                    the scaling direction upwards, but also downwards, objects seem to be homogeneous and flat, but this
                    is presented as a kind of optical illusion by zooming in and out in the video. Further, a possible
                    interpretation of the video could be that the viewing and scaling levels determine what we see, or,
                    to put it bluntly, how reality is constituted.

                The project addressed the question whether and to what extent the adoption of specific viewing
                perspectives is related to the construction of the object of observation. The observation was split into three perspectives of
                three different levels: Micro (perspectives of individuals), Meso (perspectives of
                cultural groups) and Macro (perspectives of nature). In particular, the aim is to contrast between
                different perspectives and to illustrate the extent to which the same object, viewed from different
                perspectives, is structured differently or has different definitional boundaries.
