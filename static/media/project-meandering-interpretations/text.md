The interpretation of texts is a central practice in most academic disciplines. In contrast to leisure reading, academic reading is characterized by distinct methods and practices for text analysis, e.g., close reading. In this regard, this work has explored the design space for utilizing interactive visualizations for synergizing algorithmic text analysis and human interpretation in a digital environment. 
As part of this exploration, a web-based prototype called Meandering Interpretations was developed. The interface turns the interpretation process into tangible text visualizations, making it easier to see and share how the idiosyncratic analysis unfolds. The thesis discusses the design process, the resulting prototype, and reflections on the potential of interactive visualizations for supporting text interpretation.
