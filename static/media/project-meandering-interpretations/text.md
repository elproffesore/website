The interpretation of texts is a central practice in most academic disciplines. In contrast to leisure reading, academic reading is characterized by distinct methods and practices for text analysis, e.g., close reading. In this regard, this work has explored the design space for utilizing interactive visualizations for synergizing algorithmic text analysis and human interpretation in a digital environment. A “research through design” methodology was employed to produce tangible artifacts during the process, which acted as mediators for discussing the design decisions and their ability to convey interpretative agency.
