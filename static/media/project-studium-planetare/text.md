Studium Planetare is a two-year, student-initiated and led pilot project by [Klasse Klima](https://klasseklima.org) in collaboration with the Studium Generale at the Berlin University of the Arts. The programme offers students and teachers at Berlin University of the Arts and beyond a forward-looking and interlinked range of courses on climate justice and planetary futures. To document and provide a calendar, a website was designed and developed that allows the Klasse Klima people to manage their courses and events.
