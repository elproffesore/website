Textarium is a web-based tool to support reading and writing in a more interactive and visual way. With Textarium, users can highlight text, group keywords into concepts, and embed their annotations directly into interactive essays. The interface turns the interpretation process into tangible text visualizations, making it easier to see and share how the idiosycratic analysis unfolds. The project focused on creating an augmented environment, that combines lightweight algorithmic analysis and human interpretation for exploring and communicating findings in digital texts.Additional iterations, together with [Marian Dörk](https://mariandoerk.de/), explored possible different design directions for the tool, focusing on the interplay between communication and visualization. As a result, a prototype was built that allows users to visually analyze text passages and embed their annotations in an interactive storytelling format.
