The quantity of news items published online on a daily basis is nothing short of humongous. Even one specific outlet publishes hundreds of articles, entries, and corrections that become part of the online news ecosystem. Hyper Visual Times is an artistic and investigative project dedicated to exploring the material characteristics of online news, by testing potential ways to transcend reading an individual article in favour of contextual ways to explore news. By using one year of data from two large Western news outlets – The New York Times (USA) and Zeit Online (DE) – the project introduces three essays and visualisation-driven interfaces that explore news articles en masse.

I have contributed to this project by conceptualizing and developing interactive data visualisations for the third chapter, investigating the representation of political figures in teaser images. For that I used Figma to design the interfaces, Jupyter Notebook to analyze data and Svelte and D3.js to implement the visualizations. The project was created in collaboration with <a href="https://francescamorini.com/" >Francesca Morini</a>.
