Hyper Visual Times contains a series of reflections on the circulation and consumption patterns of news in the digital environment. Using metadata from several newsrooms’ archives, each experiment deals with a feature of digital news: keywords, text, and images. Using a combination of computational methods, three individual chapters pivot around a series of design and data visualization experiments with news data.
