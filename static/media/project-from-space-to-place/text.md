From Space to Place is an interdisciplinary exploration to understand the complex interplay between environement and human interventions. The projects aim was to get a more holistic approach for understanding and mapping a space. As we researched different methods for understanding the environment from an interdisciplinary perspective, we began to shift our idea of space into a more constructed notion of "place". One of our outcomes was an installation that seeks to create an experience that allows participants to perceive the changing physical environment as a continous evolving digital representation, utilizing technologies such as pointclouds to reveal the layered transformations that places undergo.
