My name is Philipp and I’m currently studying [Design & Computation](https://www.newpractice.net/study) at Technische Universität Berlin and Universität der Künste Berlin. I’m interested in data and media visualization, interfaces and media theory. Through my studies, projects and work I aim at disentangling the weird parts of technology and want to keep afloat on this huge ocean of information.

### From Space to Place

From Space to Place is an interdisciplinary exploration to understand the complex interplay between environement and human interventions. I cooperated here with my study fellow Lora. The projects aim was to get a more holistic approach for understanding and mapping a space. As we researched different methods for understanding the environment from an interdisciplinary perspective, we began to shift our idea of space into a more constructed notion of "place". 

Throughout our project, we engaged in critical evaluation of environmental models, particularly during a workshop that sparked intriguing questions about anthropogenic markers and their implications for local political actions and future predictions. 

One of our outcomes was an installation that seeks to create an experience that allows participants to perceive the changing physical layer through the lens of the digital, utilizing technologies such as 3D Scans to reveal the layered transformations that places undergo. By highlighting the evolving relationship between places and time, our installation offers a novel perspective on how digital representations can complement and preserve the physical reality of locations as they change.

### Experimental Syllabus Site 
This project was done together with [Prof. Marian Dörk](https://mariandoerk.de/) from the [UCLAB](https://uclab.fh-potsdam.de/). A syllabus site is a website that contains all the information about a class. It is usually structured in a linear way and is not very flexible. The aim of this project was to create a new kind of syllabus site that would allow the students to explore the content of the class in a more playful way. It also allows students to see the process and prototypes from a past class. The structure of the project also provides the opportunity for non-programmers to create their own syllabus sites with a markdown file and the application automatically generates the visualisation. The visualisation is also responsive and can be used on mobile devices.

The code is [open source](https://github.com/uclab-potsdam/syllabus-site/)

There is an [explanatory site](https://infovis.fh-potsdam.de/syllabussite/) and the sites for classes of the FH Potsdam:<br>
["Decolonizing Data Visualization – Visualizing Postcolonies"](https://infovis.fh-potsdam.de/decolonizing/)<br>
["Organigrams for/from the future"](https://infovis.fh-potsdam.de/organigrams/)

### Dialectics of Climate Futures 
> Anthropogenic climate change is more relevant than ever. Despite the scientific evidence that has been gathered and substantiated in recent decades, social fronts are sharpening and polarizing. Thus, we find that the discussion about the climate crisis must not only be approached from the quantitative side, but also from the qualitative, emotional side. 

In addition to dealing with the topic using the conventional methods of economics and the natural sciences, the art and design disciplines must also assume their responsibility. In this context, the development of narratives and visions, as well as the presentation of complex the representation of complex interrelationships are of central importance. Through dialectics - the method of gaining knowledge through logical argumentation along opposing positions - we want to get out of our usual filter bubbles.

This project was part of the "Tangible Climate Data" class that investigated new ways to question and visualize the complex topic of climate change. "Dialectics of Climate Futures" wants to clarify the interwoven relationships and initiate a discourse. We use an emotionally framed artificial intelligence as a means to get in touch with opposing emotional states. Through the process of the interaction we hope to break out of thought patterns and provoke thought experiments. The goal is to ask and discuss the question:

<b>Can we find common ground?</b>

To this date the project was exhibited at the Manifest:IO Symposium for Electronic Art and New Media, the first event of the Symbiotism collective at Disko Babel and at the Ars Electronica 2023 Festival.

### Software for Community and Fun

Over the last couple of years I have come across multiple groups that try to reimagine the web. I was always fascinated by the possibilites that we have with current browser technology and how we can hack things together, especially in a safe environment where we don't have to think of data wipeouts or hacks. Additionally I often struggled with existing softwares that lacked some features like rearrangment options or forewording to other applications. I also missed fun! Therefore I sometimes come up with small personal solutions and fun projects that resemble my interests, needs and sometimes opinions :)

This works are inspired and influenced by various groups but most notably by [Ink & Switch](https://www.inkandswitch.com/) and a Twitter User named [Azlen](https://twitter.com/azlenelza)

Most of this work can be found on my [Github](https://github.com/elproffesore)
