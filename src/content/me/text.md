Hi! My name is Philipp – I'm a designer and creative technologist. I have an M.A. Design & Computation (TU Berlin and UdK Berlin) and a B.E. in Media Technologies (Media University Stuttgart). My interests include data interfaces, data visualizations, node-based interfaces, computational social science and the digital humanities. In my free time I enjoy playing table tennis, spikeball and reading books.
