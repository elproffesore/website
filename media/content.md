My name is Philipp and I’m currently studying [Design & Computation](https://www.newpractice.net/study) at Technische Universität Berlin and Universität der Künste Berlin. I’m interested in data and media visualization, interfaces and media theory. Through my studies, projects and work I aim at entangling the weird parts of technology and want to keep afloat on this huge ocean of information.

### Notespace 
Notetaking is integral to studying, brainstorming and archiving ideas that come to mind. Usually I use a small notebook to write and sketch down my ideas for projects or theoretical thinking. But there are several things that my analogous notebook doesn't provide. While brainstorming I often try to sketch my ideas and associate it with already familiar projects or other artists/designers. The sketching part is easier with the notebook but the references and associations are more usefull in a hyperlink system. I was unhappy with the solutions that are out there because they offered too many features and I couldn't integrate some features I wanted from other tools. Another really important part was the idea that I could rearrange the visualisation of my notes and also could integrate some search and analytical functions later.

### Experimental Syllabus Site 
This project was done together with [Prof. Marian Dörk](https://mariandoerk.de/) from the [UCLAB](https://uclab.fh-potsdam.de/). A syllabus site is a website that contains all the information about a class. It is usually structured in a linear way and is not very flexible. The aim of this project was to create a new kind of syllabus site that would allow the students to explore the content of the class in a more playful way. It also allows students to see the process and prototypes from a past class. The structure of the project also provides the opportunity for non-programmers to create their own syllabus sites with a markdown file and the application automatically generates the visualisation. The visualisation is also responsive and can be used on mobile devices.

The code is [open source](https://github.com/uclab-potsdam/syllabus-site/)

It is in use for FH Potsdams class ["Decolonizing Data Visualization – Visualizing Postcolonies"](https://uclab-potsdam.github.io/decolonizing/) and for the class ["Organigrams for/from the future"](https://uclab-potsdam.github.io/syllabus-site/)

### Workshop on AI in Art
I gave a small workshop that showcased the possibilities of AI in the context of art and partly in the context of healthcare. The workshop was held for the "Diagnostics" department of the company Roche and was part of their "DEGL+K Sommertagung". During the workshop teams discussed about the future of healthcare and the role of AI. The discussion was recorded and later summarized by an AI. The AI also created images that metaphorically depicted the discussion and acted that as a starting point for another discussion.

### Dialectics of Climate Futures 
> Anthropogenic climate change is more relevant than ever. Despite the scientific evidence that has been gathered and substantiated in recent decades, social fronts are sharpening and polarizing. Thus, we find that the discussion about the climate crisis must not only be approached from the quantitative side, but also from the qualitative, emotional side. 

In addition to dealing with the topic using the conventional methods of economics and the natural sciences, the art and design disciplines must also assume their responsibility. In this context, the development of narratives and visions, as well as the presentation of complex the representation of complex interrelationships are of central importance. Through dialectics - the method of gaining knowledge through logical argumentation along opposing positions - we want to get out of our usual filter bubbles.

This project was part of the "Tangible Climate Data" class that investigated new ways to question and visualize the complex topic of climate change. "Dialectics of Climate Futures" wants to clarify the interwoven relationships and initiate a discourse. We use an emotionally framed artificial intelligence as a means to get in touch with opposing emotional states. Through the process of the interaction we hope to break out of thought patterns and provoke thought experiments. The goal is to ask and discuss the question:

<b>Can we find common ground?</b>.

To this date the project was exhibited at the Manifest:IO Symposium for Electronic Art and New Media, the first event of the Symbiotism collective at Disko Babel and at the Ars Electronica 2023 Festival.
